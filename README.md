# Coding Challenge: Create a blog website (using a template engine)
This is a TypeScript Express Nunjucks Exercise from the AWD training (NF).

## Requirements

- Setup a expressjs application with typescript
- Install nunjucks template engine
- Implement [this Blog Layout](https://startbootstrap.com/previews/clean-blog).
  - You will find the download button [on this page](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog).
- The blog posts should be generated by the json data that is provided at the material section of this document.
  - Create a json file and read the data to generate the blog posts
  - Ensure that you convert the unix timestamp into a human readable format without changing the json structure
  - List the blog posts on home page
  - Provide a detail page for each blog post
    - Use this template:
    - Display the full content and the provided image (hint: you need a slug)
- Try to use macros for the form to avoid to repeat yourself to often.
- It’s ok if the form on the contact page is just hmtl. No need to implement any validation for this case.
